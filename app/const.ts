Ever since the popping of the dot- com bubble, software and online applications have been in a race against the clock to stay relevant, usable, and modern. Unfortunately, not everything we’ve loved using over the years has kept up with the times.

But just because a piece of software fell behind doesn’t mean that it wasn’t worth creating. Many great ideas have been lost to time and are waiting for the right team to pick them up, dust them off, and help them evolve.

How can we take what we loved from these old applications, sites, or projects and reimagine them in the dawning age of automation, algorithms, and AI ?

Since 2007, the amount of data in the world has increased by 2200\%, but our ability to protect that data has lagged behind. As technology has become integral to modern life, many people find themselves needing to create new accounts, download new applications, and send important information without the cybersecurity knowledge to keep their devices and data safe.

With all these cybersecurity threats, how can you help people and enterprises secure their data and devices in a user-friendly, accessible way?

Billions of websites, millions of applications, new products being launched every day... but no one seems to be adding that magic mix of features that you’ve been looking for. Think you know better than the rest? Today’s the day to turn those crazy ideas into reality, building from scratch or merging different products together to create your very own concept. 

Add new features to your favorite product, apply an existing feature in a novel way, or burn it all to the ground and create something completely different from anything we’ve seen before.The world is your oyster, push those boundaries and Make Fetch Happen.

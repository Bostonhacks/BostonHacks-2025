# BostonHacks 2025

Bostonhacks 2025 landing page.

## Notes

- Built with NextJS but exported statically. Meaning you cannot develop with NextJS features that require a server.
- Website is based on the `release` branch. Only PR from `main` to `release` to change the website.

## Getting Started

First, install node dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
